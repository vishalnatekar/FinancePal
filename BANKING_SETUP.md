## Current Implementation

Your app is already set up to work with any of these providers. The code in `server/services/openBanking.ts` is designed to be provider-agnostic and will automatically detect which API keys you've provided.

## What You Get

Once connected, your app will be able to:
- ✅ Fetch real-time account balances
- ✅ Import transaction history
- ✅ Categorize spending automatically
- ✅ Calculate net worth from all accounts
- ✅ Track budgets against real spending
- ✅ Monitor financial goals progress

## Next Steps

1. **Choose a provider** (I recommend starting with Finexer's 14-day free trial)
2. **Register and get API credentials**
3. **Add the secrets to your Replit project**
4. **Test with sandbox mode first**
5. **Go live with real bank connections**
