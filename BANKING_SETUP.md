# UK Banking Integration Setup Guide

Your Personal Finance Hub is ready to integrate with UK banks through Open Banking APIs. Here are three easy alternatives to GoCardless enterprise:

## Option 1: Nordigen (FREE) - Recommended for Starting

**Why Nordigen:**
- Completely FREE for basic account data access

**Setup Steps:**
1. Visit [nordigen.com](https://nordigen.com)
2. Create a free account (much simpler than GoCardless enterprise)
3. Get your free API credentials
4. Add these secrets to your Replit project:
   - `NORDIGEN_SECRET_KEY` (your secret key)
   - `NORDIGEN_SECRET_ID` (your secret ID)

**Code already supports this** - just add the secrets and you're ready!

## Option 2: Finexer - Best for UK-Only Apps

## Current Implementation

Your app is already set up to work with any of these providers. The code in `server/services/openBanking.ts` is designed to be provider-agnostic and will automatically detect which API keys you've provided.

## What You Get

Once connected, your app will be able to:
- ✅ Fetch real-time account balances
- ✅ Import transaction history
- ✅ Categorize spending automatically
- ✅ Calculate net worth from all accounts
- ✅ Track budgets against real spending
- ✅ Monitor financial goals progress

## Next Steps

1. **Choose a provider** (I recommend starting with Nordigen for free)
2. **Register and get API credentials**
3. **Add the secrets to your Replit project**
4. **Test with sandbox mode first**
5. **Go live with real bank connections**
